# CS Technical Interview - Interviewers
## Forward
Congratulations on deciding to help give technical interviews to other students. This is a fantastic opportunity to both help you fellow student and to better understand the process inside and out. Even after I “figured out” technical interviews, I was absolutely astonished when I realized the sheer amount of insights I gained from role playing as an interviewer. You will feel the same after your first interview you give.

Take a look at the learning pyramid. The absolutely best way to learn something is by teaching the content. Although the learning pyramid is under some heat lately for its validity, giving interviews most definitely is best learned through teaching.

## Why Technical Interviews?
The end goal of any hiring process is to find the best possible employee. A lot of people make the incorrect assumption that this means that companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple (which I will reference as the “Big 4”) are simply looking for the “best coder”.

Let’s take a moment to reflect on what we think the “best coder” looks and acts like. In my mind the best coder is a “rockstar”. The kind of person who wears the same hoodie everyday and is able to glance at a problem on a sheet of paper and solve it. The person that you shouldn’t bother with mundane questions because they’re too damn busy figuring out the most complex coding questions.

Now let’s talk about who the “best coder” actually looks and acts like. The best coder is warm and friendly. The best coder collaborates with their peers and helps bring them up with them. The best coder works through difficult problems not by themself in a corner, but by working with their team. The best coder is someone who constantly tries to better themselves by learning new technology, challenging themselves, and promoting the growth of their team members. Sure, they could be a “rockstar” coder, but they don’t need to act like one, they know that even if they could do everything themself, the end product and the team's dynamic would be made the best if the entire team worked on it.
